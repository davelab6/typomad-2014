Something in Spanihs

I do a lot of things: i teach type design in Vienna, I do my own type design, I work on glyphs, and I work as a font prodiction engineer. 

I'm happy when Glyphs is involved. I'm here not to talk about Glyphs but about OpenType features.

we have heard a lot about OpenType Features this week. You have ligatures, small caps - here's a demo with Mac OS X TextEdit's typography panel.

You can do funny stuff like this, Ingeborg has a g that changes its ear when you type a 2nd g. These are all types from Vienna, where I am from. 

I put some type specimens by the entrance, but they are all already gone! :) 

Okay, I recently did a type for a cartoonist. He is an old fashioned guy who does things analog. He had German text in an original cartoon, and he used photoshop to take a photo masking the original, write it over the top, and clean it up... I said we could make a font of his handwriting and it would be much faster to work and he could translate... we worked with Juan Carlos on this and it was great :)

An artist ... whose husband runs a restaurant. They have placemats and she asks people to fill in the grid on the placemat with their handwriting. And she put them into a font. There are 5 hands in the font, and the font rotates them. 

There was a 90s Letterror typeface Beowulf and you can kind of fake it with OpenType, so I wrote a script to make it easy to do. 

Supernett means supernice and this has a slight rotation in the stylistic sets, and one shifts the baseline, and you can activate both

Raabs is a type conference in Austria, a tiny one, and this is a digitization of a medieval one.

I was at ISType in Istanbul a few years back, and accidentally walked into a protest.

A bendy distortion of the letters

I teach type design as a part of a 2 year graphics course. In the first year we do a pixel font. Belinda Swoboda did 'Swoxel' and she wanted to do some OpenType features, so that when you write 'girl' the girl appears, and when you write . after it then it changes the face, which is a kind of animation. 

Franziska Marinovic saw this, and she did eis.car.bomb. Eis is icecream, and the food in Spain is so good, tomorrow they will have to roll me onto the plane, and Iberia will charge me extra :) So, you add a space after these words and it animates the key frames. 

The students got totally carried away; they saw what Belinda did and they all wanted to do something similar. This is all in TextEdit! Nothing special here. 

This is an octopus :) (big applause) Thank you! I will tell the designer this was a favourite here

And then Helene Krieger did Krixel (?) which has Pacman style glyphs :)

These are **references** to games, not real games. can we do it?

Yes!

Here you type # and then 1 to 9 to place your x or o on the tic tac toe grid. This keeps track of the winner too, and if you type the same number twice it scribbles out the board. 

I want AI in this, so the font plays with me. can we do that? yes!

I found another game to put into a font. There is this old 60s French movie, Marienbad, and they have 4 rows, 1 card, 3 cards, 5 cards, 7 cards. In the movie the guy on the right says he always wins. The player takes a row or part of a row, and the player left with 1 card loses. 

So you type `Marienbad` and it sets up the board :) 
```
A |
B |||
C |||||
D |||||||
```
So you type `Marienbad-A1` to clear 1 card from row A and so on. 

Now you type `Marienbad-A1,` and the font plays with me! But I always lose. You can ask a mathematician, its an "unfair game" in game theory. 

Eg `A1-C1-B3-D3-C4-D3`

So if they ask you to play first, always say no :) Look it 

Okay, I work for Glyphs too, and so I end with this message from Glyphs the TypoMad sponsor: Glyphs full price is €240, from www.glyphsapps.com, and we offer you it for €200 as a special offer, email res@glyphsapp.com (res are my initials, in Catalan this means 'nothing' :)
